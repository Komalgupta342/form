    <P>PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is a widely-used, open-source scripting language designed primarily for web development. It is embedded within HTML and is particularly suited for creating dynamic web pages and web applications. Hereâ€™s a basic explanation of PHP:

        PHP is executed on the server, which means that the PHP code is processed on the server before the result is sent to the user's web browser. The user only sees the HTML output, not the PHP code itself.
    </P>

    <!-- <?php
  if(isset($_POST['save'])){
    echo $_POST['fname'] ."<br>";
    echo $_POST['age'] ."<br>";
  }
  ?> -->

</body>
